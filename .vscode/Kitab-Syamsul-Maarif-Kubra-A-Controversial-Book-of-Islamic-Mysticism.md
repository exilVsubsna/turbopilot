They warn that the book can lead to shirk (associating partners with Allah) and kufr (disbelief) if not understood properly.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
Islamic mysticism, also known as Sufism or Tasawwuf, is a branch of Islamic knowledge and practice that focuses on the spiritual aspects of Islam. It aims to purify the heart from worldly attachments and sins, and to attain closeness and love of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him). Sufism also teaches the ethics and morals of Islam, such as sincerity, humility, generosity, patience, and compassion.
 
Sufism has a long and rich history in the Islamic civilization, and has produced many great scholars, poets, saints, and leaders. Some of the most famous Sufis include Imam Al-Ghazali, Jalaluddin Rumi, Ibn Arabi, Abdul Qadir Al-Jilani, Rabia Al-Adawiyya, and Al-Shadhili. Sufism has also influenced many aspects of Islamic culture and art, such as literature, music, architecture, and calligraphy.
 
However, Sufism is not without its challenges and controversies. Throughout history, there have been many groups and individuals who have deviated from the orthodox teachings of Islam and claimed to follow Sufism. They have introduced innovations and superstitions into the religion, such as worshipping graves and saints, performing rituals and ceremonies that are not sanctioned by the Quran and the Sunnah, and claiming to have special powers and secrets that are beyond the reach of ordinary Muslims. These groups and individuals have tarnished the reputation of Sufism and caused confusion and division among the Muslim community.
 
Therefore, it is important for Muslims who are interested in Sufism to be careful and cautious in their approach. They should not blindly follow any person or group that claims to be Sufi without verifying their authenticity and credibility. They should also not neglect the basic obligations and duties of Islam, such as prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. They should seek guidance from the Quran and the Sunnah, as well as from reputable scholars and experts who can explain the true essence and purpose of Sufism.
